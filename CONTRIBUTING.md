## Submitting Pull Requests

**Please follow these steps to simplify pull request reviews.**

- Please rebase your branch against the current `master` branch.
- Run the `Setup` command to make sure your development dependencies are up-to-date.
- Please ensure the test suite passes before submitting a PR.
- If you've added new functionality, **please** include tests which validate its behavior.
- Make reference to possible [issues](https://github.com/angular-component/router/issues) on PR comment.

## Submitting bug reports

- Search through issues to see if a previous issue has already been reported and/or fixed.
- Provide a _small_ reproduction.
- Please detail the affected browser(s) and operating system(s).
- Please be sure to state which version of Angular, node and npm you're using.

## Submitting new features

- We value keeping the API surface small and concise, which factors into whether new features are accepted.
- Submit an issue with the prefix `RFC:` with your feature request.
- The feature will be discussed and considered.
- Once the PR is submitted, it will be reviewed and merged once approved.

## <a name="commit"></a> Commit Message Guidelines

We use conventional commit messages, and use the git commit messages to **generate the changelog**.

### Commit Message Format

Each commit message consists of a **header**, a **body** and a **footer**. The header has a special
format that includes a **type**, a **scope** and a **subject**:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>
<BLANK LINE>
<body>
<BLANK LINE>
<footer>
```

The **header** is mandatory and the **scope** of the header is optional.

Any line of the commit message cannot be longer than 100 characters! This allows the message to be easier to read on GitHub as well as in various git tools.

The footer should contain a [closing reference to an issue](https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-via-commit-messages/) if any.

```
docs: update changelog to beta.5
```

```
fix: update router component to fix issue with rendering
```

### Type

Must be one of the following:

- **build**: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (example scopes: gulp, broccoli, npm)
- **ci**: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts (example scopes: Travis, Circle, BrowserStack, SauceLabs)
- **docs**: Documentation only changes
- **feat**: A new feature
- **fix**: A bug fix
- **perf**: A code change that improves performance
- **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- **style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc.)
- **test**: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests

### Subject

The subject contains a succinct description of the change:

- use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"
- don't capitalize the first letter
- no dot (.) at the end

### Body

Just as in the **subject**, use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes". The body should include the motivation for the change and contrast this with previous behavior.

### Footer

The footer should contain any information about **Breaking Changes** and is also the place to reference GitHub issues that this commit **Closes**.

**Breaking Changes** should start with the word `BREAKING CHANGE:` with a space or two newlines. The rest of the commit message is then used for this.

Example:

```
feat: commit message

Closes #issuenumber
